# Infinite Tic-Tac-Toe

A website to play Tic-Tac-Toe, but with a twist: the board is now infinite (not yet currently), and you must connect 5 to win!

## Rules
For the most part, it's the exact same as Tic-Tac-Toe, but now the board is infinitely spanning, and 5 symbols must be connected for either side to win.

Inspiration from playing this game often in my childhood with friends.

## Features
### Current
- Right now, only local two-player mode is available. Take turns with a friend to play the game.
### Future
- Making the board actually infinite lol, right now it's just a very large board
- Clicking and dragging with the mouse to see more of the board
- Zooming in and out with scroll wheel
- Playing against the computer with varying difficulties (random, easy, hard, etc.)
- Online play (?)
- Deploying
